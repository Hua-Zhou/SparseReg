## SparseReg Toolbox for Matlab

SparseReg toolbox is a collection of Matlab functions for sparse regressions. 

The toolbox is developed by [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io) and [Brian Gaines](http://brgaines.github.io/).  

### Compatibility

The code is tested on Matlab R2017a, but should work on other versions of Matlab with no or little changes. Current version works on these platforms: Windows 64-bit, Linux 64-bit, and Mac (Intel 64-bit). Type `computer` in Matlab's command window to determine the platform.

### Installation (Matlab version >= 2014b)

Download the Matlab toolbox installation file [SparseReg.mltbx](./SparseReg.mltbx). Double click the downloaded file and you should be good to go. If it does not work for some reasons, follow the below instructions for Matlab version < 2014b.


### Installation (Matlab version < 2014b)

1. Download `ZIP File` file using the links on the left.  
2. Extract the zip file.  
```
unzip Hua-Zhou-SparseReg-xxxxxxx.zip
```
3. Rename the folder from *Hua-Zhou-SparseReg-xxxxxxx* to *SparseReg*.  
```
mv Hua-Zhou-SparseReg-xxxxxxx SparseReg
```
4. Add the *SparseReg* folder to Matlab search path. Start Matlab, cd to the *SparseReg* directory, and execute the following commands  
`addpath(pwd)	 %<-- Add the toolbox to the Matlab path`  
`save path	 %<-- Save for future Matlab sessions`
5. Go through following tutorials for the usage. For help of individual functions, type `?` followed by the function name in Matlab.
6. (Occasionally) you need to re-compile the Fortran code for your specific platform. First make sure the [Matlab supported Fortran compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers.html) is available on your system and type
`mex -setup FORTRAN`
to set up Matlab compilier utility. Within Matlab, enter the `/private` folder and type `make` to compile the Fortran source code.
